There is a way of saying in dutch something is quite impressive. 

> "Dat is niet niks".

Well NotNix.com is a tribute to the whole Nix world and community as I find Nix one of the most impressive technologies of this very moment. Also I needed a home for my personal Nix-projects. I hope this place get's interesting enough to hang around.
